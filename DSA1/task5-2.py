# Section: 5. Queue

# Problem 3
# A function that rotates the queue in a circular manner
# Method name: rotate_queue
# Time complexity: Depends on the complexity of the "dequeue" and "enqueue" methods.
# If both are O(1), then the rotation will not depend on the number of elements in the queue.
# Solution: Take the value from the tail of the queue using "dequeue", and place it at the head using "enqueue".

# Problem 4
# Implement a queue using two stacks
# Class name: TwoStackQueue
# Time complexity: The "enqueue" method is O(1), and the "dequeue" method is O(1) and O(n)
# Solution: Use two stacks â€” one to push new elements, and the other to retrieve elements from the tail.
# If the stack used for retrieving elements is empty, transfer elements from the input stack.
# After transferring, elements are in the correct order for retrieval.

# Problem 5
# Add a function that reverses the elements.
# Class name: TwoStackQueue
# Method name: self.reverse()
# Time complexity: O(1)
# Solution:
# Swap the input stack and the output stack.

# Problem 6
# Implement a queue using a static array.
# Class name: FixedArrayQueue
# Solution:
# Store the position of the tail and the size of the queue as class variables.
# Also considered another variant that stores both head and tail positions and computes the size,
# but that requires more "if" checks.

# Method name: self.enqueue(item)
# Time complexity: O(1)
# Solution:
# Raise an "OverflowError" if the queue is full.
# Compute the head position by adding the queue size to the tail position.
# If it goes beyond the array bounds, wrap around to the start of the array.

# Method name: self.dequeue()
# Time complexity: O(1)
# Solution:
# Retrieve the value at the tail pointer, then move it forward.
# If it goes beyond the array bounds, wrap around to the start.


# Method name: self.is_full()
# Time complexity: O(1)
# Solution: Compare _capacity with _size. These are class variables.
# _capacity is set during initialization, and _size changes by one after each "enqueue" or "dequeue".
